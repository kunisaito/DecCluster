This implementation of 「Unsupervised Deep Embedding for Clustering Analysis」in tensorflow.
The paper is https://ai2-website.s3.amazonaws.com/publications/unsupervised-deep-embedding.pdf.

We simply implemented the method for MNIST. We do not pretrain the model from Stacked AE. We jointly optimize the objective of the AE and clustering.
