Implementation of DEC
====

Overview
Implementation of 「Unsupervised Deep Embedding for Clustering Analysis」in tensorflow.
The paper is https://ai2-website.s3.amazonaws.com/publications/unsupervised-deep-embedding.pdf. Our implementation is different from original one.
## Description
We simply implemented the method for MNIST. We do not pretrain the model from Stacked AE. We jointly optimize the objective of the AE and clustering.

##Usage
'python mnist_dec.py'

## Requirement
*python-2.7
*tensorflow-0.11.0
